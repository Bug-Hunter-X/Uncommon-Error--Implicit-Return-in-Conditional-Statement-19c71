This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python that involves implicit returns within conditional statements. The `bug.py` file contains a function with a subtle error where it does not properly handle the case when both inputs are zero, leading to undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.py` file shows the corrected version of the function, clearly addressing the potential division by zero and ensuring a defined return value in all cases.
